## 🌌 Overview

TetraKlein Genesis is the first sovereign computational infrastructure that unifies:

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography Core**  
  (SHAKE-256, Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH), Tetrahedral Key Exchange (TKE), Quantum Isoca-Dodecahedral Lattice Encryption (QIDL))
- **Golden Ratio Entropy Engine**  
  (ϕ = 1.618 seeded hyperdimensional randomness)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Sovereignty**  
  (Poseidon zk-SNARKs)
- **Sovereign Yggdrasil Mesh Genesis**  
  (No reliance on DNS or root servers)

## 🔥 Unique Cryptographic Innovations

### 🔹 Recursive Tesseract Hashing (RTH)

RTH replaces linear or 2D Merkle tree hashes.  
Instead, it recursively compresses inputs through **4D tensor structures**, simulating nested hypercubic folds.

- ✅ Resistant to linear attacks (quantum Grover search mitigation)
- ✅ Hyperdimensional entropy distribution
- ✅ SHAKE-256 chained across recursive tensors

> _"Where Merkle trees grow linearly, RTH folds inward like a Tesseract."_

---

### 🔹 Tetrahedral Key Exchange (TKE)

TKE abandons elliptic curve key exchanges.  
It generates sovereign keys by traversing **recursive nested tetrahedral graphs**.

- ✅ No reliance on elliptic curves (EC)
- ✅ Hyperdimensional basis for keys
- ✅ Resistant to Shor’s quantum attack algorithms

> _"Each key is born from the perfect symmetry of the tetrahedron."_

---

### 🔹 Quantum Isoca-Dodecahedral Lattice (QIDL)

QIDL constructs encryption layers through **Platonic icosahedral-dodecahedral field symmetries** —  
encoding entanglement patterns geometrically instead of linearly.

- ✅ Entanglement-mimetic encryption model
- ✅ Geometrically secure
- ✅ Post-linear — breaks flat plane assumptions of classical cryptography

> _"Encryption no longer lives in lines. It lives in symmetries beyond dimensions."_
