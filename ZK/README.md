# 🧪 Codex ZK Trust Circuit

This directory contains the **Groth16 zero-knowledge circuit** used to verify trust anchor scores in the Codex Constitution framework. It ensures that swarm identity validation and trust scoring can be verified without revealing any private biometric data.

> 📁 Path: `/zk/`  
> 🔒 Circuit Type: [Groth16](https://zokrates.github.io/introduction.html#zero-knowledge-proof-systems)  
> 📐 Curve: BN256 (128-bit security)  
> 🛠 Language: Circom v2

## 📜 Circuit Summary

- **Circuit File:** `zk_trust.circom`  
- **Inputs:**  
  - Private: Biometric QIDL hash, entropy salt  
  - Public: Trust threshold, timestamp  
- **Constraint System:** `zk_trust.r1cs`  
- **WASM Witness Generator:** `zk_trust.wasm`

This circuit ensures a user has a valid swarm trust signature above a threshold, without revealing private inputs.

## ⚙️ Build & Proof Workflow

Run the following script after installing [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/) and [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs):

```bash
bash compile.sh
This automates the steps:

Compile the circuit (zk_trust.circom)

Generate the witness (witness.wtns)

Run trusted setup (circuit_final.zkey)

Create proof (proof.json)

Output verification key (verification_key.json)

Test verification
